More\n            and more funding organisations and publishers will actually request that. This is in itself a reasonably\n            straightforward process, as such public archives are usually maintained by dedicated institutes or consortia\n            and these have rules, regulations, requested formats and in many cases clear instructions in how to upload\n            and retrieve your data. Please note that also here, some environments with be 'inert' non-interoperable\n            archive (or only meant to serve human re-use) and some may qualify as HPR environments, which may pose quite\n            some different challenges for you as a data creator (see also earlier consideration on updates and\n            versioning of growing or changing data sets or resources).</p>\n        <p>A more detailed consideration may be whether you consider your data 'reference' data that may be offered for\n            curation and including the addition to core data resources such as UniProt. In that case the procedures may\n            be quite different and an active interaction with the core data resource custodians is in many cases the way\n            to go. Currently, many of these resources have to painstakingly recover the data they want to use in their\n            curated and value-added resource by <em>ocular extraction</em> (reading) or by text and data mining, both of\n            which is cumbersome and error prone.

However, there is a data stewardship edge to this question as well. First\n            of all, it is obviously very important to discuss in step 1 with the best statistician you have access to\n            the nature and the (sample) size of the data you need to answer the question. That is as far as the newly\n            generated data for the experiment at hand is concerned. What is a very important data stewardship aspect\n            here is that in data driven research, very frequently OPEDAS or multiple novel data sets need to be\n            collectively analysed to get the sought-for answers. So, next to the 'data-intrinsic' aspects of size, scope\n            and quality of your data sets and the experimental versus control aspects, there is a serious challenge in\n            functional integration or linking with other data. The size, format, richness (also of metadata) and data\n            model chosen for the capture and storage of your data may be influenced by the other data that are needed to\n            get to a final interpretation of the patterns and phenomena you study.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Consider the 'functional integration and linking needs' of newly generated data with the team in step\n                1.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Choose wherever possible the same data formats, metadata standards, vocabularies and data models for\n                your new data as those that were used for the data with which your data should interact.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider and provide for the mapping, parsing and transformation jobs that may be needed to put other\n                data in a format that can makes them functionally linked and interoperable with your data.

These algorithms are very different from those that 'know the data\n            type they are running over' and therefore are strictly programmed to follow particular instructions\n            reproducibly. Machine learning is usually employed in computing tasks where designing and programming\n            explicit algorithms is infeasible. This obviously has impact on the required quality of the data.\n            Intuitively, you may think that the 'machine will figure out' what it is looking at, and that the FAIR\n            principles do not so much apply to the type of data that are used as input for machine learning. Granted,\n            the data elements themselves may be 'unstructured' (for instance a x-ray image) and thus intrinsically not\n            FAIR. However, in this case the quality and FAIR elements of the annotations as part of the metadata may be\n            even more critical than in cases where the data elements themselves are directly machine actionable and\n            'understandable' by the machine. For instance, if an algorithm is designed to learn from patterns and\n            colours in images, proper context of in what category the image should be placed is extremely important and\n            can be part of its machine actionable metadata. So again, clearly distinguish between the three categories\n            of data defined earlier: Intrinsic metadata, user defined metadata and the data elements (including the\n            'raw' data themselves.

This goes beyond the formatting and identifier related consistency of the data\n            themselves. The fact that we handle this issue under the interpretation and analysis section indicates that\n            this has everything to do with'what the data will be used for.

Two examples:\n            It may soon become cheaper to 're-sequence' a genome than to store it for 10 years. Also text mining the\n            same massive corpus of text with the same tagger and the same thesaurus, should in principle give the exact\n            same result when repeated at any time.

First of all, the technology should not change; sequencers get more reliable by the\n            day and therefore may give different results and the 'old sequencer' may not be in your possession anymore\n            by the time you want to generate the results.

Obviously, most\n            biobanks are collected for research purposes. In case the samples are of human original, or associated with\n            ethical and privacy considerations for any other reason, the stewardship aspects are significant.

One of the issues with re-using other\n            people's' data is that they cannot be assumed to be reusable from an ethical or legal standpoint without\n            explicit permission. Assuming that unlicensed data are 'free to use for whatever purpose' is intrinsically\n            wrong, and in the case of for instance Pharmaceutical industry can lead to court cases later on. Therefore,\n            whenever you publish a data set or any other kind of information or digital object, it is important to\n            define a license for reuse. For software many licences exist, and for data, increasingly, standard licenses\n            are available or under development. Please note that a given license is also a defined concept and therefore\n            deserves a Persistent Identifier and a URI pointing to where the license can be studied (machine readable\n            licenses are also under development in some areas). This means that in the metadata, the license under which\n            the data or the workflow can be reused is 'just another PID in the right place'. Users can then specify in\n            their search or workflow container that 'only data with the following licenses should be included'.</p>\n        <p>For instance, if you include some data in your analysis that cannot be used for commercial purposes, that\n            decision may render your entire results not usable for commercial purposes (at least in the view of some\n            lawyers). This means that not licensing your data at all, even if you don't care who uses them and for what\n            purpose is very counterproductive and will severely undermine the actual reuse of your data by others and in\n            particular by industry. It will also lower the attribution-rate (usually part of the license conditions) and\n            thus the citation and the impact score of your data.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Always carefully choose a license to be attached to your data upon publication.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Include and clearly mark the licences PID as a concept + attributes in the metadata.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Store and 'expose' the license as part of the metadata in Open Access environments where search\n                engines can easily find the license, even of the data they describe are not (yet) FAIR or even highly\n                restricted in access. The 'fact' that a data set with a specific license is 'out there' is a first step\n                toward effective reuse of your data or information source.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure, especially when you restrict use of your data, that you are able to enforce the license\n                you choose.

However, to\n            be the basis of reproducible results based on the same data, the workflow and all elements it uses (such as\n            for instance thesauri for text mining, lists of reference data etc. need to be exactly the same. However, in\n            many cases one or more of the components are not well documented, maintained or versioned (people you do not\n            control decide on updates without even informing you). So, consider writing new software or algorithms for\n            data analysis without the need to as a first capital sin for good data stewardship. Unless you are the very\n            first to run a particular type of experiment, more likely than not software and workflows/pipelines for the\n            type of processing and analysis you need will already exist.</p>\n        <p>Even if you use 'existing' Open Source (OS) software produced in your scientific community, verify first that\n            there is proper support, versioning and documentation about the code. If not, you run a serious risk to run\n            into irreparable reproducibility problems very soon. In many cases, workflow decay in the public sector is a\n            very serious problem. Next to that, many OS workflows are based on serial running of web service-type\n            components. If one of those is 'off-line' or changed (without proper management and notice) your workflow\n            will either not run properly or give unexplainable variations in results. It is therefore of the utmost\n            importance and core business for data stewards to ensure that the software components you decide to use are\n            of sufficient stability and quality to take the risk to subject your valuable data to them.

One of the issues with searching for other\n            people's data is that they can not be 'intrinsically indexed' as easily as for instance documents on the\n            web. For that reason many data sets and databases go unnoticed and are at present heavily underutilised.\n            This does not only hold for small and highly specialised databases. Even core resources such as the Human\n            Protein Atlas are unknown to many researchers and much of the information in those databases is not readily\n            available for indexing and all kinds of synonym problems preclude effective finding of such data and\n            information sources. Many attempts are underway to develop data search engines, which are all challenged by\n            the enormous variety in metadata standards, formats and data formats themselves. If all metadata were in\n            FAIR format, the development of effective and highly performing search engines for all data sets available\n            in the 'Internet of Data' would be infinitely more easy.

So in any case,\n            for a small or a large study, you have to consider the possibilities of local versus distributed computing.\n            The options range literally from using smart-phones to distributed supercomputers heating homes and\n            connected via glass fiber to exascale computer facilities. It is not a 'given' anymore that massive compute\n            and analysis jobs have to be done centrally and within firewalls even when sensitive data are involved. If\n            we define the 'cloud' as 'other people's computers' in general, most of what you need to do may be perfectly\n            feasible 'in the cloud'. However, there may be reasons to do things locally and maintain expensive compute\n            infrastructure. Still, never buy locally maintained hardware if there are better and cheaper options 'just\n            for the sake of controlling it'. No-one would generate electricity or clean water anymore unless as a backup\n            generator or in case the water needs to be of exceptional quality that can not be delivered from external\n            sources. Compute and Storage rapidly becomes such a 'general commodity' and using it externally or in the\n            'cloud' becomes a major issue to address. The core question is: how much 'compute' capacity needs to be\n            immediately associated with the data. Recognising the speed of current connections in your network is\n            obviously a major aspect here. This again pertains to whether you plan to send massive data sets over\n            networks (where network speed may still be a major cost and time issue) or 'light weight' workflow\n            containers that visit data <em>in situ</em> to do relatively restricted compute job.</p>\n        <p>There are emerging trends that show that many more scientific questions can be answered by distributed\n            analytics and learning than we would intuitively believe. Therefore it is considered bad data stewardship if\n            you burden our institution with internal hardware and software issues that can be done by trusted third\n            parties much better, cheaper and safer.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Study and consult carefully on cloud based options for the storage and compute you will need.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Compare different cloud services providers for pricing, service and security (bigger is not always\n                better).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure you are allowed to 'send data around' before going down that path.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider that up- and download pricing of regular cloud providers will be very considerable of you\n                deal with really large data sets.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Balance the costs you will be incurring using a cloud provider with the costs of local facilities</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Calculate the risks of procurement, maintenance, support, expertise, and renewal of machinery and\n                infrastructure in your own institution as well.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Choose the right local/distributed approach for each individual workspace and 'batch' of analysis\n                (not a one size-fits-all approach).</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Just assume that the storage and data processing will be done 'in house' without a very strong\n                justification for that (major costs and logistics involved).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Buy or hire much more computer space and power than you actually need.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider every compute job a 'compute and data are altogether' situation.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Confuse 'large scale compute problems' with 'large scale' local infrastructure.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"links\">\n        <h2>Links</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://github.com/DSQResources/DSQ-wia\" target=\"_blank\">DS Question GitHub resources repository: wia</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

In addition, there may be privacy, legal or commercial restrictions that prevent the\n            data from physically leaving your internal repository'. These issues are extremely important to be carefully\n            studied at the early stage of data generation, as they may influence your generation, licensing and\n            stewardship choices. If data cannot be 'shipped' the environment in which you offer them for reuse is\n            critically important.

Here we re-introduce the term 'data publishing'. As we should treat\n            re-usable data sets with the same care as we are used to for research articles, we need to make sure that\n            optimal use by others, citation and sustainability are all covered and properly budgeted for. For research\n            articles, it has long been accepted that external parties take part (for a fee in Open Access) in the\n            formatting, redaction, peer review, publishing and preservation of your narrative article and the\n            accompanying resources (supplements). Think about data in the same way. They are a valuable output of your\n            research and should be 'published' in their own right, regardless of any articles (sometimes more than one)\n            you might want to base on the data. Obviously, the description of the data should be rich enough to make\n            them actually re-usable by others. That means aspects of Findability (including good metadata and a\n            persistent identifier), Accessibility (Open Access, restricted, license as well as 'download-ability' or\n            '<em>in situ</em> accessibility' for analytics. In the 'article' sphere, interoperability of the outcome was\n            largely related to 'readability for other human users' and this again is largely confined to proper\n            language, rhetoric and formatting, issues that are usually co-judged and improved in the 'peer-review'\n            process. However, interoperability of data is more complicated. Text is a nightmare for computers as we\n            already described, so machine readable and actionable met data formats and data formats are critical. For\n            most data types standard formats, and increasingly also metadata format are available and these should be\n            used wherever possible. Human reviewers will increasingly be unable to 'check every line' of your big data\n            sets and therefore will have to rely on the formats and standards you used. We expect more and more\n            computable 'quality check and integrity check' tools in the data space but these are not yet available for\n            all data types.</p>\n        <p>This all means that your study plan (or proposal) should adequately budget for data publication in FAIR\n            format. Tools are under development to certify your (meta-)data as FAIR but these are in their infancy and\n            therefore you may need to spend considerable time, effort and funds to get your data in the correct format,\n            to have it checked and to actually publish it. The good news is that these publishing costs are mostly\n            'eligible costs' in research proposals and they also include the long-term archiving of these data. One data\n            are in the correct format and 'static' in size and shape, the long-term storage can usually be easily\n            budgeted and justified.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Carefully budget for the publication of your data.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Check various data publishing providers and check whether they are trustworthy (for instance\n                approved/certified by the funder of your research).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Compare prices of different publishers and specifically also whether they include long-term\n                preservation of the published data.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Restrict this part of your budgeting effort to the actual 'archiving' as a basic preservation\n                cost.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Budget separately for potential storage and copies of the data in HPR environment, which might be\n                very worthwhile to increase reuse and citations on your data and thus 'impact'.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Check whether your institution has a data access committee or an equivalent body.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Mix one-off formatting, review, quality checks etc. with real 'publishing' of the data in a format\n                and environment that will make the FAIR (with again the main consideration being machines, the prime\n                'users' of digital large data sets.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Assume that an Open Source, Open Access Academic repository is always the best option for the funder\n                and the actual reuse of your data.

These aspects have been covered in general terms before but here we need to emphasize that\n            it is your task as a data steward to prevent unexpected capacity problems in hardware, but also human\n            capacity that may cause delays or even waste of generated data once the experiments have been set in motion.\n            This does not only cover the capturing of the raw data, although this is the most urgent issue to address.\n            You should also be fully aware of the stability of data and samples generated in each step of the\n            experimental process. In many cases, samples taken from physical or biological systems for example have a\n            very limited stability and measurements on them can be heavily influenced by the time lapse between the time\n            point at which the sample was taken and the time the actual measurement of its features and values took\n            place. Again, this is mainly a part of general good research practice and the co-responsibility of the\n            entire team, but your role as a data steward is to maximally ensure that variations that may be traceable to\n            time-lapse or other experimental conditions are properly recorded and therefore traceable. For instance the\n            exact position of each sample in the container used for measurements (for instance a 96-well plate) and the\n            time it took to run the entire plate through the measurement procedure can prove to be extremely important\n            for later processing and analysis of the data. If it is well established that for instance fluorescence of a\n            marker has a given decay over time, differences between the first well in the plate and the last one may\n            have to be corrected for that before the data can be processed further to be meaningful.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Make sure you fully understand the 'sources of potential variance' that are relevant for the\n                experimental study at hand and that you advise the research team on which metadata and process\n                descriptive data have to be captured to minimise risk of data loss or lack of harmonisation, calibration\n                and correction procedures.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Capture all reasonably possible metadata and data about laboratory procedures again following the\n                'better- throw-away-than-regret-not-to-have' principle.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Ensure that correction, harmonisation and calibration procedures on the data are also considered as\n                part of the experimental process and therefore monitored and captured as such.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Consider yourself out of loop during the actual experiment and see yourself merely as the recipient\n                of the data when they come out of the experimental workflow process.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider the deep knowledge about experimental procedures (not necessarily the hypothesis being\n                tested or generated) none of your business and the realm of the experimentalist, but act as an intrinsic\n                member of the research team, also during this step of the data cycle.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Start the actual data capture process without the best possible knowledge about the future use of the\n                data and the requirements to be able to compare them with OPEDAS without cumbersome and error prone <em>post\n                    hoc</em> harmonization processes.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

As discussed in section 4, for most data types\n            and metadata needs there will be earlier examples, community emerging standards and publication as well as\n            linking, integration and analytics workflows that can handle FAIR data.</p>\n        <p>As of 2014, a growing series of so called 'Bring Your Own Data workshops have been organised where data\n            owners of various basic data types have worked with FAIR data experts to represent their original data in a\n            FAIR manner at the metadata level and in many cases also to turn (part of) of their core data into FAIR\n            format. In most cases this procedure did not<em>replace</em> their original database, but it merely exposed\n            part of their data in a FAIRpoint, meaning that FAIR-aware tools will find them and will be able to operate\n            in that subset of the data. By the time you read this book, many data types will have been 'done before' and\n            an increasing number of concepts you will have to refer to in your (meta)data will be covered by community\n            compliant and supported vocabularies. There are international efforts and research infrastructures in most\n            domains that are in full swing to develop tools, standards and best practices for their domain where these\n            do not exist. Granted there may be large differences in maturity of data type registries, proper, controlled\n            vocabularies, mapping services between those and ontologies &nbsp;dependent on the scientific domain, but\n            increasingly, front line research will have to link and meta-analyse data from different domains and\n            disciplines. It is therefore imperative for interdisciplinary and open science that your data 'talk\n            optimally' to other data within your domain and also to data from other domains. Therefore, your search for\n            'pre-existing best practices, formats and standards' should not stop at your disciplinary border. One of the\n            best approaches to get acquainted with best practices of the data type you have at hand is to turn to\n            establish research infrastructures in your domain or consult certified data stewardship nodes in your\n            domain, or for instance the Research Data Alliance.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Consult experts, preferably associated with established research infrastructures in your domain.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Consult also outside your domain (there may be a vocabulary in agriscience you may want to extend for\n                a biodiversity project, or one in meteorology you may be able to use for part of your geology data, as\n                well as one in chemistry that may cover the metabolites you want to refer to).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Detect concepts or formats that you need and for which no appropriate 'prior art' is Findable or\n                Re-usable in your specific case.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Always approach research infrastructures or services (like ELIXIR, NCBO or EPOS) for advice.

However, there might\n            be several (and rapidly accumulating) reasons to choose for a HPR environment anyway. First, in case you are\n            internally rewarded for the reuse of your data (unfortunately only a fledgling practice to date) there may\n            be great benefits in choosing a HPR, as the chances that others will actually reuse and cite your data will\n            be naturally (much) higher. Second, the participation in a FAIR HPR environment may give you extremely\n            valuable feedback on your data over time. Not only through reuse <em>per se</em>, but for instance also\n            through annotation (by others) and by progressing insight created through other people's research that may\n            reveal new patterns or associations in your data that may lead to further insights, claims and publications.\n            Therefore, considering the much higher costs to offer the data yourself in a HPR or 'submit them to one of\n            the emerging HPR environments is a worthwhile exercise. In many cases, private providers will be eager to\n            include your data in HPR environments they provide (such as highly performant analytics graphs and\n            visualisations), this may sometimes only pertain to part of your data, but it could expose your data in\n            multiple HPR environments without you bearing the costs of the provision in those environments. The HPR\n            provider makes a living by re-formatting, analysing, linking and integrating your data with OPEDAS and\n            although the data as such as open and freely delivered to the HPR provider, an entire market on value added\n            services around data is rapidly developing while you read.</p>\n        <p>In case you decide with the team that running your own HPR is not within your reach for technical, expertise,\n            support or financial reasons, you may still consider to offer them formally for reuse in an existing HPR\n            environment (Open Access or commercial). In other words consider the 'value' of your data up to the point\n            where they may be an asset for commercial HPR providers in the cloud that may help you in publication (for\n            free) in their desired format or even pay you for your data.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Carefully consider the pro- and cons of HPR provision of your published (metadata)</p></li>\n            <li><p>Clearly distinguish between 'local' HPR environments (very costly) and joining an existing HPR\n                provider where you let them offer your data in the desired format.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Discuss the 'value' of your data in the team, with your supervisors and make sure that due credit is\n                given once your data actually does get reused and cited.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Lightly assume that just publishing your data (albeit FAIR) in an 'inert' repository is always just\n                enough to claim good data stewardship.

The term 'publishing' has its roots in the notion of\n            making assets (traditionally text or images) 'public'. No matter how much this term has undergone semantic\n            drift in the current scholarly 'publishing' practice, we wish to stick to the original notion. So data\n            archived in your local repository are not automatically 'published'. &nbsp;There may be a very good reason to\n            keep them just 'archived' for internal reuse (obviously with all backup and safety issues discussed earlier,\n            but here we assume that you want to really publish your data for external reuse. These costs should be\n            eligible for the funder of your research and are comparable in nature to the APC for Open Access articles.\n            However, it is not the responsibility of the creator of the data to keep the data in an HPR environment for\n            many years for others to reuse. Reuse of OPEDAS is costly and part and parcel of proper budgeting for\n            modern, data intensive research projects. So the actual reuse of OPEDAS in HPR formats should be eligible\n            research costs in future grants. Open data are not free in terms of 'gratis' to reuse. This includes data\n            and data infrastructure resources that are very intensively used. These should be recognized at some point\n            as 'core infrastructure' and partly funded as a common good and/or from reuse fees.</p>\n        <p>In the total offering of open access publishers, obviously reliable reuse of the article for in principle an\n            indefinite time is included. Storing huge data sets however, will be significantly more expensive (at least\n            initially) than storing text. So long term preservation costs need to be taken into account. There is also a\n            major difference between publishing (FAIR) data in a basic trusted repository where both people and machines\n            will be able to find them, know under which conditions to access them (the F + A of FAIR) and between\n            offering your data in fully Interoperable format, in a High Performance Reuse' (HPR) environment. Here we\n            already warn you that HPR provision of your data to others is typically at least an order of magnitude more\n            costly in terms of hardware and accompanying service and support than just 'publishing them' in a format\n            that makes them principally FAIR. If your data are published, found and reused by others as OPEDAS, the new\n            user will have to bear the costs to actually include the data in a re-analytics environment. So, publishing\n            data is a different decision from maintaining (yourself) a HPR environment for them. Writing massive data to\n            'tape' and storing their rich and FAIR metadata in the 'cloud' will be usually still considered good data\n            stewardship. The tapes can be found, accessed and the data can be retrieved in interoperable and thus\n            re-usable format, may be at significant costs, but these should be borne by the re-user. The choice of your\n            repository is extremely important though. Not only costs may differ significantly between the many emerging\n            professional data publishers, but matters of trust and solid sustainability and support issues are minimally\n            as important. In very general terms, professorware based local repositories are about the worst place to\n            publish your data, but there will be as many 'data sharks' at the market soon as there are 'text sharks'\n            today. So be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of various data publication options and don't take any\n            beautiful web site at face value. The general attitude you may best adopt as a good data steward in open\n            science is that money is not made on the data (as an asset with paid access0 but on services around the\n            data, including HPR services, smart analytics etc.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Publish data either internally or externally, but in all cases make sure you use reliable and\n                sustainable repositories.</p></li>\n            <li><p>If published externally, make sure to use one of the certified trusted Data Repositories and trusted\n                publishing groups.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish your (FAIR) metadata about the data set in a public repository, regardless of where the data\n                themselves are stored.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make a clear difference between 'inert publishing' and High Performance Reuse offering and budget for\n                both separately</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make extremely clear as part of the FAIR metadata under which conditions the data can and may be\n                reused (this goes way beyond a license and may for instance tell the user -frequently a machine- where\n                to find the raw data and which steps are necessary to reload them in an HPR etc.)</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Confuse archiving with publishing and 'inert publishing' with HPR offering.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think that keeping data internal (even if for very good reasons like Patient privacy) relieves you\n                from the good data stewardship practice to publish rich and FAIR metadata about the internal data set in\n                a public and findable place, even if those metadata tell the potential re-user that reuse will be highly\n                restricted.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think too easily that your data have not been produced with public funding, and therefore you are not\n                morally obliged to at least expose the metadata to the rest of the community.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think that when you work in a private company all this does not apply to you.

However, the actual FAIR publishing of\n            data is not yet as obvious. The example of the FANTOM5 paper in the introduction is a good demonstration of\n            how data that 'are associated with' a paper can be an very important asset by itself, but will also cost\n            significant time and effort to be published in FAIR format (in this case nanopublications). If we stick to\n            the principle that data needs to be published in FAIR compliant formats to be optimally re-usable, separate\n            planning for the capacity and the resources to do so is part of good data stewardship. Publishing an Open\n            Access article with the actual data still being hardly Findable (hidden in supplementary data files on the\n            deep web or without proper dedicated metadata), Accessible (in non-computer readable format and without a\n            proper license) Interoperable (textual or non-community adopted identifiers) and thus very difficult to\n            reuse should be considered bad research practice. &nbsp;Therefore the data on which a paper is based should be\n            published in its own right and the 'supplementary article' (preferably Open Access) should be regarded as\n            the description of the rationale, the methodology of the study that generated the data and the\n            <em>first</em> set of conclusions and claims based on the paper. Returning to the FANTOM5 paper, the number\n            of derivative papers based on the same dataset effectively shows the 'bankruptcy' of the classical\n            publication method. The data set is key and all papers (including the first 'mothership' paper) could\n            (should?) be seen as derivatives.</p>\n        <p>Now the question arises how much of your data can be open access. As argued before, open science requires\n            open access to be the default approach. However, there are situations where the data can not be made\n            available in open access without restriction, even if the first and all subsequent derivative textual\n            publications can be open access. For instance, data that are national security sensitive, or privacy\n            sensitive such as patient data may have to be restricted in access. Obviously, this poses a fundamental\n            issue already for peer review as the reviewers would have to 'trust' that the conclusions drawn in a\n            particular derivative paper are based on solid data and represent credible conclusions. Therefore, even if\n            raw data are to be restricted, a good data steward will always do everything needed and possible to provide\n            a data set (anonymized for instance or aggregated) that allows the best possible review, reproduction and\n            openness. In case the underlying raw data have to be restricted the provenance of the process that lead to\n            the 'open data' needs to be as comprehensive as possible and the FAIR metadata of the restricted set should\n            still be Open Access, including the Accessibility begin well explained (License, procedures to follow if\n            access to the restricted data is to be requested etc.). However, data publishing may be many orders of\n            magnitude more expensive than publshing narrative A small example: One modern instrument (for instance\n            cryo-EM) easily produces around 1 terabytes (TB) per day. Thus, a typical high-end instrument research group\n            that uses the available instrument time efficiently produces 100-300 TB per year. Typically, projects take\n            1-3 years, resulting in requirement of approximately 200-600 TB of storage for active projects. let's assume\n            that the finder of the research requires that after completion, the data must be archived for at least 10\n            years. Thus, a data intensive research group may have to archive 2-6 petabytes of raw data over 10 years.\n            Current (academic) prices are in the range of 50 Euros/TB/year + 180 Eu/TB/year for backup and for archiving\n            108 Eu/TB/year. So storing onepeta byte. So storing 1000 terabytes in a proper way might add up to well over\n            100.000 euros/year, just for archiving. This means that a data steward needs to budget very carefully for\n            data storage archiving and back-up.</p>\n        <p>A very important decision is: what part of the data to publish where and how. Storing metadata or annotations\n            in a FAIR format and in a HPR environment is almost trivial from a cost perspective and may be enough to\n            make the actual data optimally reused.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Include resources in your study budget for the FAIR publishing of your data and/or metadata,\n                regardless of whether they can be fully open access.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Be aware that publishing of large data sets may actually be much more expensive than publishing the\n                accompanying article.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Work closely with experienced FAIR data colleagues and data publishers in- or outside your group to\n                make sure that you indeed make the best (and affordable) technological, format and terminology choices\n                that can be considered FAIR.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Choose a Trusted Data Repository to deposit the data once they are in FAIR publishable format.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Choose an appropriate license for the the data and include a machine readable identifier for that\n                license in your metadata.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure your data are citable.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider raw, processed, and metadata separately for publication choices.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Separate these data categories but ensure a resolvable permalink between them.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Publish (supplementary) data in PDF or any other non-machine readable format rendering them elusive\n                for most text mining programs.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Assume that publishing the data coming from your experiment requires a budget that is in the margin,\n                or even in the range of the APC of the articles you publish.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish any data without proper reference to the workflows and other research objects that were used\n                to generate and analyse them.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish without a serious check on price, trust and quality of the provider.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

      "<div class=\"bookref\" id=\"bookref_7_1\">\n    <h1 class=\"question\">How much will be Open data/access?</h1>\n\n    <section class=\"whats-up\">\n        <h2>What's up?</h2>\n\n        <p>Open Access is a term frequently associated with 'science 1.0' when scholarly communication was still largely\n            done via academic journals, later <em>extended</em> to the co-publication of 'supplementary data'. The\n            actual text contained the new claims and the argumentation around them. The publishing system slowly became\n            perverse as text was hidden behind firewalls (as researchers published 'for free') and then the reader\n            should pay. Open Access as we know it is just another business model where the 'polluter pays', in other\n            words, now the author pays a publication fee and the text is free to read for everyone. Much as this is an\n            improvement, it does not fundamentally support Open Science better than the old system. First, authors in\n            less fortunate institutions can not easily pay for publication and are again put in a disadvantaged\n            position. Second, there was already far too much to read anyway, now there is even more to read. Third,\n            data, the key asset for Open Science is not necessarily more Findable in Open Access papers then in closed\n            papers (the TIFF walls and the broken links are not necessarily better). Therefore <em>publishing data in\n                their own right</em> in Open Access is extremely important and a key task for a good data steward. We\n            also need to clearly distinguish between metadata and the actual data here. It can be argued that metadata\n            of any research object, regardless of whether it is an article, a data set or a piece of software should be\n            FAIR and Open Access (the A in FAIR is distinct from Open as was discussed before). There might however be\n            very good reasons to keep text or data under well defined, but restricted access. This may have routes in\n            patient privacy or national security considerations, but (especially for data generated in the private\n            sector) also reasons of competitive advantage. However, the latter is very difficult to argue for data that\n            are generated with public funding. They should be considered a public good by default and arguments to keep\n            them from reuse by others will have to be argued in any data stewardship plan with very strong arguments. &nbsp;\n            Arguments to separate massive and crude data from FAIR metadata have also been discussed earlier. The raw\n            data may be too bog to keep in a High Performance Reuse (HPR) environment (typically orders of magnitude\n            more costly than for instance on tape). So in general, FAIR metadata make that your data and tools can\n            participate in the FAIR open science ecosystem.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Clearly consider for each data set whether it is considered generated by public or by private funding\n                (or a mix)</p></li>\n            <li><p>Take as the default that metadata are always FAIR, with the A being Open Access without any\n                restrictions.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make a conscious decision with the research team for the best license to put on any given data set\n                (the actual data elements.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Include the intended level of restriction in your data stewardship plan (even at the proposal stage).\n                Again for most funders the default will be Open, so in case you want to argue for a more restrictive\n                license, prepare your arguments extremely carefully as they may influence your chance to get the\n                proposal awarded.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Work wherever possible with Open Source software, but never at the expense of aspects of\n                professionalism, versioning, documentation, sustainability and (SLA) support.</p></li>\n            <li><p>When dealing with software: make your code open source under a well defined license, but consider\n                sustainability issues before doing so.

The term 'publishing' has its roots in the notion of\n            making assets (traditionally text or images) 'public'. No matter how much this term has undergone semantic\n            drift in the current scholarly 'publishing' practice, we wish to stick to the original notion. So data\n            archived in your local repository are not automatically 'published'. &nbsp;There may be a very good reason to\n            keep them just 'archived' for internal reuse (obviously with all backup and safety issues discussed earlier,\n            but here we assume that you want to really publish your data for external reuse. These costs should be\n            eligible for the funder of your research and are comparable in nature to the APC for Open Access articles.\n            However, it is not the responsibility of the creator of the data to keep the data in an HPR environment for\n            many years for others to reuse. Reuse of OPEDAS is costly and part and parcel of proper budgeting for\n            modern, data intensive research projects. So the actual reuse of OPEDAS in HPR formats should be eligible\n            research costs in future grants. Open data are not free in terms of 'gratis' to reuse. This includes data\n            and data infrastructure resources that are very intensively used. These should be recognized at some point\n            as 'core infrastructure' and partly funded as a common good and/or from reuse fees.</p>\n        <p>In the total offering of open access publishers, obviously reliable reuse of the article for in principle an\n            indefinite time is included. Storing huge data sets however, will be significantly more expensive (at least\n            initially) than storing text. So long term preservation costs need to be taken into account. There is also a\n            major difference between publishing (FAIR) data in a basic trusted repository where both people and machines\n            will be able to find them, know under which conditions to access them (the F + A of FAIR) and between\n            offering your data in fully Interoperable format, in a High Performance Reuse' (HPR) environment. Here we\n            already warn you that HPR provision of your data to others is typically at least an order of magnitude more\n            costly in terms of hardware and accompanying service and support than just 'publishing them' in a format\n            that makes them principally FAIR. If your data are published, found and reused by others as OPEDAS, the new\n            user will have to bear the costs to actually include the data in a re-analytics environment. So, publishing\n            data is a different decision from maintaining (yourself) a HPR environment for them. Writing massive data to\n            'tape' and storing their rich and FAIR metadata in the 'cloud' will be usually still considered good data\n            stewardship. The tapes can be found, accessed and the data can be retrieved in interoperable and thus\n            re-usable format, may be at significant costs, but these should be borne by the re-user. The choice of your\n            repository is extremely important though. Not only costs may differ significantly between the many emerging\n            professional data publishers, but matters of trust and solid sustainability and support issues are minimally\n            as important. In very general terms, professorware based local repositories are about the worst place to\n            publish your data, but there will be as many 'data sharks' at the market soon as there are 'text sharks'\n            today. So be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of various data publication options and don't take any\n            beautiful web site at face value. The general attitude you may best adopt as a good data steward in open\n            science is that money is not made on the data (as an asset with paid access0 but on services around the\n            data, including HPR services, smart analytics etc.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Publish data either internally or externally, but in all cases make sure you use reliable and\n                sustainable repositories.</p></li>\n            <li><p>If published externally, make sure to use one of the certified trusted Data Repositories and trusted\n                publishing groups.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish your (FAIR) metadata about the data set in a public repository, regardless of where the data\n                themselves are stored.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make a clear difference between 'inert publishing' and High Performance Reuse offering and budget for\n                both separately</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make extremely clear as part of the FAIR metadata under which conditions the data can and may be\n                reused (this goes way beyond a license and may for instance tell the user -frequently a machine- where\n                to find the raw data and which steps are necessary to reload them in an HPR etc.)</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Confuse archiving with publishing and 'inert publishing' with HPR offering.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think that keeping data internal (even if for very good reasons like Patient privacy) relieves you\n                from the good data stewardship practice to publish rich and FAIR metadata about the internal data set in\n                a public and findable place, even if those metadata tell the potential re-user that reuse will be highly\n                restricted.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think too easily that your data have not been produced with public funding, and therefore you are not\n                morally obliged to at least expose the metadata to the rest of the community.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think that when you work in a private company all this does not apply to you.

Computers can not easily cover rhetorical strings and\n            arguments and therefore narrative (although inherently ambiguous and thus not FAIR) is needed to explain to\n            people what was discerned in the data, how the data were generated and what is the basis of the conclusions.\n            Part of all this, including methods etc. can be increasingly also captured in machine actionable format and\n            therefore become part of the machine actionable FAIR ecosystem, but 'supplementary narrative text' with your\n            data will always be needed and obviously review articles describing a whole field etc. will always play a\n            role as long as human minds are part of the scientific process. However, when you write narrative, in\n            whichever component of what you want to publish, take care to <em>never</em> introduce ambiguous symbols and\n            formulations in the text. Narrative with synonyms and beautiful style figures may be more entertaining for\n            people to read, but these do usually not at all serve the well-defined and straightforward scientific\n            reasoning, but rather blur it. More importantly, they make text even more of a nightmare from machine\n            reading, text and data mining than they already are by their very lingual nature. Unexplained acronyms (<em>people\n                will know what I mean</em>) with multiple meanings (homonyms) alliterations, nested sentences and\n            sentences of the style [concept 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are all related to concept 6 in table 5] are <em>absolute\n                malpractice</em> in text. In fact, a good exercise to internally check whether any narrative you add to\n            your data is reasonably unambiguous, is to 'also' represent as much as you can of the text in a machine\n            readable format and publish that along with the actual text. That means that if you use terms such as\n            'intellectual disability' and 'mental retardation' interchangeably or the same symbol for a gene and its\n            corresponding protein, machines (and people alike) can at least check the unique identifier used in the\n            machine friendly version in order to 'understand' what you actually mean. This exercise also forces you to\n            structure your reasoning as precisely and logically as possible, so it will also improve the quality of your\n            text. Also, refer to equipment, reagents and methods with unique identifiers linked to the term, and avoid\n            using unspecific terms, jargon etc. Those sentences that cannot be represented in a machine readable format\n            even after you tried probably represent exactly that (crucial) portion of your narrative that is needed to\n            explain to other people 'how, why, and on what basis.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Make a great effort to make any narrative you have to produce as straightforward and unambiguous as\n                possible to make it more readable for both machines and people.

You will\n            find some literature here to read up on it if you need to. There was a time that major textual resources\n            were not mined properly and individual researchers needed to recover concepts and their relations from text.\n            However, nowadays, for many text corpora, there are well designed and state 0f the art collections of\n            concepts, co-occurrences and relations mined by specialised consortia.

More and more examples appear in the literature [references] demonstrating that new\n            discoveries can be made entirely based on 'OPEDAS'. As the generation of new experimental data is very\n            expensive and time consuming. The rigorous questioning of the need to do so is part and parcel of good data\n            stewardship for discovery. For a data driven scientist the optimal use of OPEDAS should be a default\n            attitude. IN many cases however, you may need to create a (usually comparatively small) data set based on\n            experiments, questionnaires or other observations. In that case it is obviously crucial that your data\n            'talk' to OPEDAS relevant for the interpretation of your new data, and that they can be processed by\n            machines and workflows in conjunction with OPEDAS. Therefore, in addition to the usual statistical and\n            'methods' considerations when designing an experiment or a study, the way data are captured, formatted and\n            published is a crucial D4D consideration and therefore data stewards should be regarded as essential expert\n            colleagues already in the design phase of any study. Again, data stewardship is not just a service to others\n            for whom your data will become OPEDAS, but the analysis and interpretation of the new data will be\n            infinitely more easy, effective and reproducible when they 'feed into' standardized formats and workflows.\n            (resources)</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Go through a very serious (and documented!) effort to search for opportunities to optimally use\n                existing research data collection infrastructure in your institution or consortium.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure your new data collection applies all criteria for both safeguarding or data quality and\n                preservation as well as the F.A.I.R. principles for all data (if possible, see for example 1.13) but\n                certainly for all annotations and intrinsic metadata as described for reference data in general (refer\n                back to 1.12.) and register your collection in one of the existing data catalogues (see resources)</p>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Assume that your data will never be used as OPEDAS or even reference data and therefore 'personalised\n                data stewardship' (a metaphor for messing with your data in isolation) is acceptable.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Create an isolated and likely unsustainable dataset based on public money without proper\n                infrastructure and without F.A.I.R. annotations and metadata.

It is obvious\n            that you can not walk with the researcher in the field that takes water or soil samples, be at the table of\n            the pathologist that takes a tissue sample or the microscopist that makes sections, stains, embeds and\n            preserves them, nor can you walk with each research assistant approaching people with questionnaires.\n            However, careful consideration of how data capture procedures that have a strong non-standardised (human)\n            component such as active questioning of subjects or surgical procedures may influence the ultimate data you\n            will have to steward is a key task for a good data steward. Very much like machines may need to be\n            calibrated at regular times and data may slightly vary based on how long ago that calibration took place,\n            different students may cause different biases in the filing of questionnaires based on subtle signals they\n            send to the interviewed person. Obviously, as with machines, the data steward cannot change that, but for\n            instance, careful recording of who took what survey when and under which conditions is extremely\n            important.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>'Know your source': make sure that when data are generated in 'variable circumstances by\n                non-standardizable agents (such as humans) you are aware of that and you have procedures in place to\n                detect unintendedly introduced variance (and correct for it if possible).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Discuss data-view based concerns with the research team and make sure that all data and sample\n                collectors are optimally aware of the value of standard operating procedures but also of the need to\n                record any abnormality encountered during the data capture procedure.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Keep all records of the capture and pre-processing procedures even after data have been harmonized\n                and normalized.

However, it may also\n            be true that you need only particular components of a workflow. When workflows are based on serialised\n            components (for instance web services) that can be relatively independently deployed, it may be an option to\n            use only part of an existing workflow. However, be aware of the stability issues related to web services. In\n            case web services are maintained by academic groups, there may very well be issues related to proper\n            documentation, versioning and support that can severely hamper your experimental procedures. If the\n            reliability of the average web service is 80% (up-time, versioning etc.) and you need a sequence of 5 web\n            services to run your workflow, do the math on how likely it is that the entire workflow will run smoothly.\n            Therefore, if professional tools exist (even if they are proprietary and not Open Source) carefully study\n            and discuss the balance between using Open Source software that you can adapt yourself, its professional\n            support level (which may cost you regardless of the license situation of the software) and the use of\n            commercial software (Open Source or Closed). There is obviously a tendency in academia to use Open Source\n            software whenever possible, but this is not always adding to efficiency, just to 'perceived freedom to hack'\n            and also sometimes based on a strong bias against 'commercial software' and the fear for 'vendor lock in'.\n            These fears are not always unjustified but going for unprofessional 'hacks' just to save some money (in the\n            short term) or based on your desire to be able to 'change and tweak' things yourself (or even worse, purely\n            motivated by the desire to publish on something new <em>per se</em>) may not at all be the best servant for\n            your research team. Laboratory analysts would be punished immediately if they crafted their test tubes\n            themselves or made their reagents in a non GLP environment, so why would that be acceptable for data\n            analysts? So the choice of workflow engine is as much a team choice (with your advise) as the choice to use\n            reagents such as antibodies from a commercial (guaranteed) provider versus producing them in the lab by\n            immunising mice. Questions to be answered in the process of choosing an existing workflow, engine or service\n            include considerations about the ease of custom developments. For instance; can a workflow be edited\n            collaboratively, can you reach out to and collaborate with the developers? Does it support the compute back\n            ends you need?, does it offer standard tools for the administrative operations? What is the ease of adding\n            new tools, does it support nesting of workflows? is it easy to use, also for non-computer experts, for\n            instance does it have a running and easy GUI?</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Check the various workflow options and engines, not only for promised functionality but also for:</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Level of documentation, support, licensing and reliability.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Keep in mind that your final responsibility is the quality of the processed data, not to make new\n                algorithms.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Get in direct contact with the workflow engine provider and follow training if necessary.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Run the workflow, engine, pipeline on exemplar data first.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Take the 'running' environment into account and check the sustainability of that environment (for\n                instance Galaxy)</p></li>\n            <li><p>check who in the team will have to operate the workflow (experimentalists and ICT people may prefern\n                very different UI's)</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Develop new workflows or workflow engines unless demonstrably unavoidable and consented by the\n                team.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Use unsupported tools or environments 'just because they are easy to access and OS'.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Discard the idea to use commercial or otherwise proprietary workflows without careful consideration\n                and discussion with the rest of the team, especially when your data are difficult to reproduce.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Expect purely academically published and 'provided' workflows and web services to be 'up and running'\n                all the time and consider an entire workflow as one unit, without inspecting all serial elements of it\n                for reliability and usefulness.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"links\">\n        <h2>Links</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://github.com/DSQResources/DSQ-ydj\" target=\"_blank\">DS Question GitHub resources repository: ydj</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"
